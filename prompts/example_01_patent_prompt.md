### 🔍 Prompt (Strong Version)

```
Provide a detailed analysis of the requirements for direct patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271(a). In your answer, identify the elements a plaintiff must prove, and explain each element.

Refer to at least two Federal Circuit cases between 2020 and 2023 that illustrate how those requirements are applied (cite the cases by name and year). Also, distinguish between literal infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, and discuss any differences in proving each.

Assume the jurisdiction is U.S. federal court. Respond in approximately three paragraphs using a formal legal tone.
