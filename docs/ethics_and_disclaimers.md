## 🔐 Legal and Ethical Boundaries

* **No Legal Advice**: None of the prompts, examples, or outputs shared in this repository constitute legal advice. This material is for research, education, and experimentation only.

* **Human Oversight Required**: Any use of AI in legal contexts must be supervised by a qualified legal professional. Outputs must be reviewed, verified, and adapted for actual legal use.

* **No Client Representation**: This repository and any generated content may not be used to represent clients, submit filings, or make legal determinations in any jurisdiction.

## 🧠 AI Limitations and Risks

* **Hallucinations**: LLMs can produce factually incorrect or invented legal content ("hallucinations").
* **Jurisdiction Confusion**: Models may confuse legal systems or apply incorrect standards unless explicitly instructed.
* **Bias and Fairness**: LLMs can reflect or amplify social and legal biases. Prompts should be crafted with awareness of potential harm.

## 🧾 Prompting Responsibilities

When using this repository or adapting its content:

* Be clear about **who the prompt is for** (e.g., law student, AI tool, legal tech app).
* Include **disclaimers** in all automated outputs.
* Avoid creating tools that provide **legal advice to consumers** unless you are authorized to practice law.

## 🌍 Jurisdictional Warnings

Legal systems vary dramatically across countries and even states. A prompt that works for U.S. federal law may be misleading in a civil law system like Germany or Peru.

Always:

* Specify the jurisdiction in your prompt
* Confirm the legal validity with a qualified expert in that system

## 📎 Recommended Use

* For academic research, legal hackathons, internal experimentation, and prototyping.
* Not recommended for use in court filings, client interactions, or unsupervised legal tools.

> 🧠 AI is a co-pilot, not a substitute for professional legal reasoning.
